 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Stanimir's Game Development & Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   Hey, it's Stanimir here. I've always been intrigued by the world of video games and the processes involved in creating them. Even though I didn't initially have much interest in programming, I decided to learn the basics of programming language C#. Afterward, I was fortunate enough to have the guidance of two amazing teachers who helped me re-learn the fundamentals and get more interested in game design.

With my classmate, I participated in a local game jam and we won. That was a turning point for me, as it gave me the inspiration and confidence to pursue a career in game development. Over the last six months, I have been collaborating with other scripters, sound designers, and artists to create captivating games. My experience has given me a strong foundation in Unity and C#, which allows me to work effectively with my team to bring our game concepts to life.

As a game developer, I'm passionate about creating immersive and engaging experiences for users. I'm always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of game design and to tell meaningful stories that resonate with players. My ultimate goal is to continue developing games that capture the hearts of players and leave a lasting impact.
