#👨🏻‍💻🎮 Stanimir Lambov

**`Junior Game Developer`**

Greetings! I am Stanimir, an enthusiastic and driven game developer. My passion for storytelling is channeled through game development as a means of expressing my creativity. I have accumulated four years of industry experience, mastering Unity and C# to design immersive experiences. I have made notable contributions to the field by winning a local game jam, and I thrive in collaborative environments where game concepts are brought to life. Additionally, my aptitude for project management enables me to work autonomously. My primary objective is to deliver an unparalleled user experience and convey my passion for storytelling through my craft.
